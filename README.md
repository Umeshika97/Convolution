# 1 INTRODUCTION 


In mathematics, the element of x is in the component of a set X uniquely is called, the domain of 
the function. In addition, the function is exceptionally addressed by the arrangement, everything 
being equal (x, f (x)), called the graph. In numerous fields of probability, physics, statistics, 
differential equations, spectroscopy, signal processing and image processing, computer vision 
and engineering are used functions for their various purposes and its applications. In these fields, 
are needed to operate new functions using given two functions. At that time, the mathematical 
operation of a convolution comes to play. It is implemented as the basis of the result of a new 
function after an integrated multiplier of both input functions which one input function is called 
signal and the other input function is reversed and called the kernel. The convolution can be 
categorized using dimensions which are one dimensional Convolution and two-dimensional 
convolutions. And also, one dimensional Convolution can be categorized using data types of 
function which are Convolutions for continuous functions and Convolutions for desecrate 
functions. This report is mainly based on one dimensional Convolution for continuous functions, 
desecrate function and two-dimensional scenarios. Furthermore, the main objective of this 
practical was to gain brief knowledge about convolution operation, Implementation and 
visualization of convolution for one-dimensional functions for discrete functions, applying and 
visualization discrete convolution function for continuous functions upon vectoring them, 
defining new algorithm to show images properly, implementation of the one-dimensional 
discrete convolution function to the two-dimensional scenario such as Applying the convolution 
operator to images.
Currently, convolution is designed and implemented using computational numerical analysis such 
as finite impulse response filters in signal processing and image processing using algorithms. 
Therefore, the main purpose of this practical was to design, Implement and visualize the 
convolution for one- and two-dimensional functions for discrete and continuous functions by 
using the high-level programming language of Python 03. Python 03 is an object-oriented 
scripting language, and it has been easy to understand. Currently, python 03 is used in a lot of 
computational areas because it is utilized familiar English syntaxes which are easy to understand 
and learn. Not only that it is free to open software, and everyone can download it freely. And 
also, python has standard libraries which can import and get the output easily. There are the vital 
benefits of learning python that has allowed debugging of snippets of code and interactive 
testing. There are various fundamental packages are used for numerical calculation and graphical 
representation such as Opencv, math, NumPy and matplotlib
